In order to compile medusa you need at least CMake 2.8.3 and libboost-1.46.1.
If you want to compile the Qt interface on Windows and using MSVC++, you need at least qt version 4.7.1 and libboost must be compiled with the following arguments.
bjam (or b2)
  -a (Needed to rebuild everything)
  --build-type=complete (build release/debug static/dyn)
  address-model=64 (If you want to build the binary in 64bit mode)
  cxxflags=-Zc:wchar_t- (For qt compatibility...)
  --with-filesystem (Required)
  --with-python (Optional, needed if you want build pydusa)
